# 🎲Rock-Scissors-Paper 🎲

A console-based Java implementation of the “Rock – Scissors – Paper” game.

It’s a simple two player game, where you and your opponent (the computer) simultaneously chose one of the following three options: “rock”, “scissors” or “paper”. The rules are as follows:


•	Rock beats scissors (the scissors get broken by the rock)
•	Scissors beats paper (the paper get cut by the scissors)
•	Paper beats rock (the paper covers the rock)


The winner is the player whose choice beats the choice of his opponent. If both players choose the same options (e.g.”paper”), the game outcome is “draw”. 


**Input and Output**

The player enters one of the following options:

•	rock
•	scissors
•	paper

The computer choses a random option, then reveals the winner.
