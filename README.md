# 🎲Rock-Scissors-Paper 🎲

A console-based Java implementation of the “Rock – Scissors – Paper” game.

It’s a simple two player game, where you and your opponent (the computer) simultaneously chose one of the following three options: “rock”, “scissors” or “paper”. The rules are as follows:
```


-	Rock beats scissors (the scissors get broken by the rock)
-	Scissors beats paper (the paper get cut by the scissors)
-	Paper beats rock (the paper covers the rock)
```


The winner is the player whose choice beats the choice of his opponent. If both players choose the same options (e.g.”paper”), the game outcome is “draw”. 


# **Input and Output**

The player enters one of the following options:
```

-	rock
-	scissors
-	paper
```

The computer choses a random option, then reveals the winner.
